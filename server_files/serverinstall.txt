Instructions to run the server scripts on a local installation

-- Use python 2.7

-- Ensure pip is for python 2.7
To check this type "pip -V"
if it says python 2, ignore the block below

If the default pip version is for python 3, we need to force it to use python27:
	prefix all pip commands with:
		"py -2.7 -m"
	so for "pip install flask" it should look like "py -2.7 -m pip install flask"


2. Install libraries:
	pip install flask
	pip install flask-socketio
	pip install eventlet
